# Inventory-Monitor
The apk file for Inventory Monitor

This project originated from a request from my mum to create an app that can help her business by keeping records of her tools - how many she stocks, how many she uses up or adds, on what dates. It was originally supposed to be just for her but I decided to make it general and I plan to release it on the app store. 
It's database driven and has more features than described above, and when I publish it on the app store, I'll add online backup features for the perfect finish.
